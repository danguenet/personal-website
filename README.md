# Welcome to my website!
This is a personal website that I built to write blog posts. I plan to write about my experiences as a marketing operations professional. I hope the content can help others in their careers.


## Spotlight

Spotlight is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). I did make many altercations from the original template, but it is still clearly a Spotlight template. The less design decisions I have to make the better the website will look and the more time I can spend on making content for the site.

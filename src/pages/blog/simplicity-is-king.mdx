> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." 
&ndash; Leonardo da Vinci

When I first started in marketing operations, I found joy in designing overly complex and intricate solutions.
The work I did was great to showcase to stakeholders. I got to talk about all the cool things it would do and
all the actionable data it would provide. Unfortunately, this was good in theory, but not in practice.

I had overlooked a handful of flaws with over-engineered solutions:
- they rely on many moving parts
- they are hard to understand upon revisiting them
- they often have a large surface area for flawed human input

## Relying on Moving Parts

This one is pretty simple. The more complex a solution is the more things that can go wrong. This is something that
took me a while to notice. I was building tons of complex things and at first, nothing was going wrong with them. But
as the complex solutions started piling up, I noticed we were running into more and more issues. 

I had thought my solutions were perfect and on their own they potentially were. But I had created the equivalent of a
knot of necklaces. They each looked pretty on their own, but when you put them all together, they became a tangled mess.
The real issue was that each process touched too many things to remember. So a dependency in one process I created months ago
might break because of a new project I was working on. And this problem only gets worse the more people that are doing
admin work in your system.

## Hard to Understand

Okay, so the first thing breaks and now you have to debug the issue. You open up the mess of workflows and other assets that
are a part of the process. Hopefully, you created some documentation for it, but even then it is too complex to understand.

You start looking at some of the decisions made and are not sure why you made them. Should you change the baffling decision 
or are you forgetting some minute, but important detail? And you haven't even started to pinpoint what was causing the issue
in the first place. 

You may say that this is a problem with the documentation. I disagree. If you have to write a 10-page document to
walk through every design choice you made, then you have an over-engineered solution. Documentation in marketing 
operations should be high level and the workflows and other assets should be simple, readable, and understandable.

## Flawed Human Input

Everything you do in marketing operations should be centered around data. The sooner you understand that the easier your job will be.
You might be thinking, "But hey, what about the user experience on the processes I create?" And that is a valid point. You 
should be thinking about the user experience for everyone involved. 

But at the end of the day, all your processes will create data that relies on data upstream and create data for downstream 
processes. And if the data is inconsistent or flawed, then you have failed in your role. Your internal stakeholders will stop 
trusting the data which will make your job very hard. 

Anytime you automate something, you can ensure it will be consistent. Computers follow instructions perfectly, which is 
why you have to be very specific with your instructions. Humans are not like this at all. Each person may interpret your 
instructions differently. Even worse, they could forget the process and guess what to do rather than checking your documentation. 

The best solution for this is to limit the amount of human input in your process, which I find many complex solutions rely 
heavily on. There is a time and place for human input, but you have to work hard to ensure they input it in a consistent way.

Anytime I have to rely on human input, I do a few things:
- Automate as much as possible
- Remove ambiguity
- Provide easy-to-access and easy-to-understand documentation

On top of that, I also try to catch any human input errors as early as possible. This is often done by creating a report that 
includes any data that does not look right and I get it emailed to me each morning in a "delinquency dashboard."

But at the end of the day, if your process relies on human input, you should always be looking for a way to remove it.
Your data will thank you. 

## Find Joy in Simplicity

Designing a solution that solves everything asked and more feels great. Stakeholders are happy when you present the 
solution, but soon they will realize it doesn't deliver as promised. This is why as marketing ops professionals, we 
need to start finding joy in simplicity.

You see, simplicity can be fun in its own right. You get a problem or project and you should try to solve it in the
most simple way possible. This puts a constraint on you that is as enjoyable as designing the perfect theory solution.
And the resulting process and data will be much better in practice. Often times trying to have it all will result in 
inferior results.

You can draw a parallel to the world of software development. There is this philosophy in programming called KISS.
It stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid. And often times the best engineers make code changes that will remove lines of code
and not add them.

>“The best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, 
code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write new code, you should do so 
reluctantly, under duress, because you completely exhausted all your other options.” 
&ndash; Jeff Atwood

You have to think of marketing operations as a no-code or low-code software engineering job. You may not be adding lines 
of code, but every additional step in a process is similar to adding a new line of code. You have to think about how to 
make the process as simple as possible.

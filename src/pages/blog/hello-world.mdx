Welcome to my website! Most of my career has been trial and error to figure out the best way to do things.
I wish, I had a resource that could have fast-tracked me to this point. I hope this website can be that 
resource for you. I will be writing about the things I have learned and tips on how to progress in your career.

In this blog, I don't plan on turning a simple topic into a 10,000-word Ted Talk. I know for SEO long-form content does very well,
but I'd rather be direct and actionable with my words. That way you can consume the information, apply it to your own work, and 
figure out if it works for you.

## How I built this website

I built this website using a template from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/). In the past, I have tried building 
personal websites from scratch using various static site generators. I always underestimated the amount of time it would take
to design and code all the layouts and components. Using this template and building the site using Next.js, I was able to 
get it up in a few days. I spent the majority of the time making alterations to the template and then copywriting the content. 

I am using [GitHub](https://github.com/danguenet/personal-website) to host the website code. When I push new code to GitHub, 
it deploys it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify is a great static site hosting service 
that I have used in the past. I am also leveraging Netlify Forms to pass the subscribers to my email service provider.
If you have any questions on how you can do this yourself or any feedback for myself feel free to reach out to me through 
[email](mailto:danguenet@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danguenet/)!

I hope this blog turns out to be a great resource for you and please share it with anyone else you think would enjoy it!

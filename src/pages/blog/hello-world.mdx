Greetings and welcome to my website! As someone who has learned through trial and error throughout my career,
I understand the value of a helpful resource that can fast-track your progress. My aim is for this website to 
be just that for you. I'll be sharing the things I've learned and offering tips to help you advance in your career.

My approach to blogging is direct and actionable. I won't be turning simple topics into 10,000-word Ted Talks 
for SEO purposes. Instead, I'll offer concise information that you can easily digest, apply to your own work, 
and determine if it works for you.

Curious about how I built this website? I utilized a template from <a href="https://tailwindui.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind UI</a> 
and built it using <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>. 
This approach saved me a lot of time compared to my previous attempts at building personal websites from scratch 
using static site generators. Most of my time was spent tweaking the template and writing content.

To host the website code, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/danguenet/personal-website" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and 
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. Whenever I push new code to GitHub, it deploys to Netlify, 
a great static site hosting service I've used in the past. I'm also using Netlify Forms to pass subscribers to my 
email service provider. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via 
<a href="mailto:danguenet@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danguenet/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

My hope is that this blog becomes a valuable resource for you, and I encourage you to share it with anyone else who 
might enjoy it. Thank you for visiting!

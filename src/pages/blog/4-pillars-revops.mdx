*I promised to keep my blog posts short and to the point, but in my first post, I wrote at length. It was my fault for choosing a 
topic with so much depth. Despite this, I hope you find the post enjoyable and useful. Moving forward, I'll strive to be more concise in my writing.*

Revenue Operations aims to unify Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success teams to create a cohesive approach that enhances the customer experience and 
drives revenue growth. By breaking down silos, Revenue Operations promotes collaboration and a holistic perspective for the revenue teams. 

During my tenure as a Revenue Operations professional, I've identified four essential pillars that are crucial for successful RevOps teams: 
Technology, Data, Process, and People. These pillars work together to power revenue growth. Before delving into the pillars, it's important 
to outline what is expected of RevOps.

## Expectations of Revenue Operations

Revenue Operations is a support function within organizations. Our objective is to assist our internal customers in achieving their goals. 
This can be challenging, given the many approaches to reaching those objectives, but we strive to identify the most efficient path forward.

In Software Development, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces is a common approach. I've applied this 
principle to RevOps by identifying four pillars that help break down our focus.

## Technology

Early in my career, I believed I was technology agnostic, as many tools in the market have similar features. However, what I 
discovered was that the real differentiators in these products are their ability to integrate well into your existing tech stack.

Typically, the core of your tech stack is your website, marketing automation platform, and CRM, as they are the glue between 
all the other tools you use. Ensuring that every new tool you onboard communicates well with your core stack can prevent headaches down the road.

However, beware of the fallacy that new tools will solve your problems. At many companies, I've reduced the tech stack upon 
arrival, not because each tool lacks value, but because being spread too thin across too many tools makes it difficult to extract that value.

Always make sure that when you bring on a new tool, you have the time to implement it properly, and the team using the tool has 
the bandwidth to get the most out of it. I prefer a leaner tech stack to facilitate this, but if you have a specific need that a 
tool can address, then it's worth making the time to onboard it.

## Data

RevOps has a responsibility to equip individual contributors with data that helps them perform their tasks effectively. For instance, a 
Business Development Rep can be given a list of accounts within their territory that match the Ideal Customer Profile and have demonstrated 
buying intent. Similarly, managers can be given Dashboards that help them make key decisions, such as a Demand Generation Dashboard that 
shows which campaigns are generating the most MQLs and revenue, allowing the team to decide which campaigns to focus on and which ones to 
adjust or cut.

However, in many organizations, data is not only inaccessible to those who need it, but there is also an overall lack of trust in the data. 
Therefore, it is crucial to have a well-documented and agreed-upon data governance strategy.

Data governance is typically used in software engineering, but it can be adapted to work in RevOps. The goal of data governance is to 
ensure that the data used is accurate and consistent. This is achieved by defining the data lifecycle and assigning ownership to each 
stage. It is also helpful to define what good and bad data looks like at each step in the lifecycle. The owner is responsible for keeping 
the data accurate and consistent until it is passed on to the next owner.

For example, marketing can own the data from the moment a lead is created until it is handed over to sales as a Marketing Qualified Lead. 
Some of their responsibilities may include ensuring that the agreed-upon fields are completed, such as First Name, Last Name, Company, 
State, Lead Source, and ensuring that the data is consistent (e.g., State is represented by the two-letter abbreviation, and lead source 
fits the defined buckets).

Sales and CS will be responsible for manually interacting with the data. This includes logging calls, updating the status of leads, tracking 
the status of meetings and next steps. Consistently doing so can generate actionable data. However, this requires well-defined data governance 
and well-documented processes.

## Process

While data governance is important, it won't solve all your data-related problems. To complement it, you need to have well-documented processes 
for whenever people or automation interact with your data. I like to think of manual processes as Jeff Atwood thinks of code. The best manual 
process is no manual process. 

>“The best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has 
to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because 
you completely exhausted all your other options.” - Jeff Atwood

This is obviously an oversimplification. The point is any process is an opportunity for introducing bad data or inconsist data. So any 
process should give us very strong and actionable data as a trade-off. **The overhead of too many processes, both manual and automated, 
is often overlooked.**

You should also fight as hard as you can to automate full or parts of your manual processes. And where you cannot, you should make 
sure you provide the person in charge of that process with very clear documentation. **Clear documentation that is easy to access is 
key to ensuring that the process is followed consistently.** And it never hurts to include guard rails like validation rules where you can.

Clear documentation and data governance are a great start, but they are not foolproof. To further ensure the quality of your data, 
it's essential to create what I call "delinquency reports." These reports will alert you when the data does not look right, allowing 
you to quickly identify and address any issues.

By implementing these reports, you can ensure that your data maintains its quality throughout the entire data lifecycle.

## People

Now that you have the right technology, data strategy, and documented processes in place, it's important not to forget about 
the people who will be using the tools, owning the data, and following the processes.

To ensure your success as a Revenue Operations professional, you need to invest in your internal customers. This includes aligning 
everyone on the strategy and goals, making sure they know how to maximize the tooling you provide, and training them on good data 
governance. You should also provide them with resources to reference when they need a refresher on the processes.

Once you have created a comprehensive RevOps machine, your last responsibility is to ensure that the right data gets to the right 
people at the right time. This could mean giving accounts to your ABM Marketer to add to their target list, or providing CS managers 
with a report that shows which accounts are at risk of churning.

To meet these data needs, you may need to add new processes or iterate your data governance strategy. Remember, the job of RevOps 
is never done as long as key decisions are being made. Accurate and actionable data will always be necessary.

## Summary

Revenue Operations was created as a way to break down the silos between Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success. This can be accomplished by 
following the four pillars of RevOps: Technology, Data, Process, and People.

**Technology:** 
Your website, marketing automation platform, and CRM are the core components of your tech stack. Any additions should address 
a problem or need, and onboarding should be thoughtful with a well-trained team to extract maximum value.

**Data:** 
Define good data governance, assign ownership for each stage of the data lifecycle, and define what constitutes good and 
bad data at each stage and who has access to it.

**Process:** 
Automate as many manual processes as possible to ensure consistency. All manual processes should have clear and easily accessible 
documentation. However, processes do increase overhead and should provide outsized value in return, which is generally actionable data. Leverage 
validation rules or other guardrails where possible and create delinquency reports to ensure data quality.

**People:** 
People are the most important part of RevOps. Align teams on goals, train them on tools and processes, and provide them with the data they need 
to excel. This could be in the form of dashboards, reports, data fields, or alerts.

The job of RevOps is never done, but this approach will create a solid foundation to build upon.
